Article 21 Water is water that SWP contractors may receive on intermittent,interruptible basis in addition to their Table A water, if they request it. Article 21 water is used by many SWP contractors to help meet demands when allocations are less than 100 percent. The availability and delivery of Article 21 water cannot impact the Table A allocation of the any contractor's water, nor can it negatively impact normal SWP operations.
