This is the Delivery Capability Report **Re**sults **Con**sole (ReCon), an interactive tool designed to complement the Delivery Capability Report. ReCon allows users to explore and visualize key outputs of the DCR 2023 CalSim 3 models, providing a dynamic and engaging way to understand delivery performance and capabilities.

The Delivery Capability Report presents California Department of Water Resources (DWR) analysis of the State Water Project (SWP) system and provides important planning information for users of SWP water. The analysis provides information about how changing climate, regulatory, and operational considerations impact SWP delivery capability.

**The most salient findings of the DCR 2023 are:**  

* Under existing conditions, the estimated average annual delivery of Table A water for this report is 2,202 TAF/year, 119 less than the 2,321 TAF/year estimated for the 2021 Report.
* The likelihood of existing condition SWP Article 21 deliveries being greater than 20 TAF/year has increased by 4 percent relative to the likelihood presented in the 2021 Report.
* Under the climate change scenarios, the estimated average annual delivery of Table A water shown in the three scenarios is 13 percent to 22 percent lower than under existing conditions.
