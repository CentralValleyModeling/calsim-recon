Welcome to the Delivery Capability Report **Re**sults **Con**sole (ReCon), an interactive dashboard designed to complement the 2023 Delivery Capability Report.

The Delivery Capability Report is used widely both within and outside the SWP for water supply planning. The information in these reports is a key component of the drought planning done by the SWP and is fundamental to the drought planning done by the Public Water Agencies that receive SWP and Central Valley Project water. The Report provides the information needed by these agencies to develop and manage their own water supply portfolios and is an important input for Sustainable Groundwater Management Plans, Urban Water Management Plans, Agricultural Water Management Plans, and Integrated Regional Water Management Plans. 

**The most salient findings of the DCR 2023 are:**  

* Under existing conditions, the estimated average annual delivery of Table A water for this report is 2,202 TAF/year, 119 less than the 2,321 TAF/year estimated for the 2021 Report.
* The likelihood of existing condition SWP Article 21 deliveries being greater than 20 TAF/year has increased by 4 percent relative to the likelihood presented in the 2021 Report.
* Under the climate change scenarios, the estimated average annual delivery of Table A water shown in the three scenarios is 13 percent to 22 percent lower than under existing conditions.
