This page provides annual and monthly averages for four hydrologic metrics: Eight River Index, Sacramento River Runoff, San Joaquin River Runoff, and Oroville reservoir inflow.

Additional monthly average plots are provided for Oroville reservoir inflow. One is inflow during drier years (Dry and Critical Sac Valley Index) and the other is inflow during wetter years (Wet and Above Normal).
