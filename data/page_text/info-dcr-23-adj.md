This is the DCR 2023 Baseline using Adjusted Historical Hydrology.

The DCR 2023 uses adjusted historical hydrologic conditions as its 
baseline, as it is more representative of current conditions. The intent of the 
adjusted historical hydrologic conditions data set is to provide a reasonable 
representation of recent climatic conditions and serve as a basis for creating 
future climate change scenarios.
